                <p>Hi! I am <span class="special-green">Roma Mudnal</span>! I am a dedicated student at UT Austin, pursuing degrees in CS Honors and Canfield Business Honors. </p>

                <p>There are many websites like it, but this one is mine! It was built using plain old HTML and CSS. Who needs bloated JavaScript frameworks? It is 2024. If I ever needed some reactivity, I'd just use some good ol' HTMX and call it a day. One of the modern plights of mankind is javascript bloatware, and I am doing my part to keep the ocean clean!</p>

                <p>I am the lovely and beautiful girlfriend to the lovely and esteemed <a class="special-green" href="https://nathan.rs">Nathan Barry</a>! He is so very handsome, and I am so very lovely, so together, we make a perfect couple!</p>

                <p>Some things that I wrestle with in my free time is the nature of central banking. Back when I was a wee little girl, I read the book "The Creature from Jekyll Island" which covered the history of the Federal Reserve. I used to be an "End the Fed" Rand Paullian, but after reading more about the founding of America and the troubles early America had without a central bank, I realize how complicated monetary policy actually is and how little we understand the full scope an action can have on an entire economy. Sound money and forced economic responsibility or flush liquidity and easy to access capital to foster economic growth. Like everything in life, it is nuanced!</p>
